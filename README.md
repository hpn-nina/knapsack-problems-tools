#knapsackProblemtools

This is my work appyling OR tools and DEAP framework in AI class at school. Hope it would be helpful in some ways. I have writsten the two notebook that contains how to use OR tools and DEAP framework with Genetic Algorithm. It is just some innocent work and have lots of mistake in the progress of learning new things. Hope it will not make you annoy.

There are a folder called KnapsackOR which contains all of mine test cases but in .kp type, you can read it as .txt. Besides that, there is a folder called testcase which have test cases but in .txt form. You can choose to use whatever you like.

The two notebook that contains Python code for running and plotting graphs are KnapsackOR.ipynb and KnapsackGA.ipynb. The data for plotting running result is contain in runResult folder.

This is the end of my description. Hope you have a nice day. Sunday, 09 May 2021.
